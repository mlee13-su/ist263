    I really like K-Pop since I lived in Korea for 12 years. I especially love NCT 127 who makes the unique music and performance ever.
    I also love to watch baseball game since I was 12 years old. Dodgers is my favorite, and LG is my favorite Korean baseball team.
    I also love Studio Ghibli, especially obsessed with Miyazaki Hayaoâ€™s products.
